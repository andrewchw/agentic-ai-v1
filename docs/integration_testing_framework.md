2. **Choose Appropriate Class**
   ```python
   class TestEndToEndWorkflow:      # For workflow tests
   class TestPerformanceIntegration: # For performance tests  
   class TestComplianceIntegration:  # For compliance tests
   ```

3. **Follow Naming Convention**
   ```python
   def test_descriptive_name_of_what_is_being_tested(self):
   ```

4. **Include Assertions**
   - Performance thresholds
   - Data integrity checks
   - Privacy compliance validation

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Add test case to this document
   - Update acceptance criteria
   - Update performance benchmarks if needed

### Updating Demo Data

1. **Customer Data Updates**
   - Maintain 20 records for consistency
   - Ensure Account ID uniqueness
   - Include diverse edge cases
   - Maintain Hong Kong-specific patterns

2. **Purchase Data Updates**
   - Maintain realistic product catalog
   - Update pricing based on Three HK current offerings
   - Ensure account overlap for testing
   - Include temporal spread

3. **Validation Steps**
   ```python
   # Run validation after updates
   python -c "
   import pandas as pd
   customer_df = pd.read_csv('data/demo/demo_customer_data_comprehensive.csv')
   purchase_df = pd.read_csv('data/demo/demo_purchase_data_comprehensive.csv')
   
   # Validate structure
   assert 'Account ID' in customer_df.columns
   assert 'Account ID' in purchase_df.columns
   
   # Validate relationships
   customer_accounts = set(customer_df['Account ID'])
   purchase_accounts = set(purchase_df['Account ID'])
   overlap = customer_accounts.intersection(purchase_accounts)
   
   print(f'Account overlap: {len(overlap)/len(customer_accounts)*100:.1f}%')
   assert len(overlap) > 0, 'No account overlap found'
   "
   ```

### Performance Threshold Updates

1. **Monitor Trends**
   - Track performance over time
   - Identify degradation patterns
   - Update thresholds based on infrastructure changes

2. **Update Test Assertions**
   ```python
   # Example: Update performance assertion
   assert processing_time < 2.0, f"Processing too slow: {processing_time:.3f}s"
   ```

3. **Document Changes**

       # Test implementation
       assert compliance_condition, "Compliance requirement not met"
   ```

3. **Validate with Sample Data**
   - Use representative PII patterns
   - Test both positive and negative cases
   - Verify masking/anonymization behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Demo Data Not Found

**Error:** `Demo data file not found: data/demo/demo_customer_data_comprehensive.csv`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la data/demo/

# If missing, check git status
git status data/demo/

# Restore if needed
git checkout data/demo/demo_customer_data_comprehensive.csv
```

#### 2. Privacy Processing Failures

**Error:** `Privacy pipeline processing failed`

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify encryption key setup
3. Check storage permissions
4. Review logs for specific errors

#### 3. Performance Test Failures

**Error:** `Processing too slow: 15.2s`

**Investigation:**
1. Check system resources during test
2. Compare with baseline performance
3. Look for new dependencies or changes
4. Consider infrastructure differences

#### 4. Memory Usage Exceeded

**Error:** `Memory usage too high: 800MB`

**Solutions:**
1. Check for memory leaks in recent changes
2. Optimize data processing algorithms
3. Implement data streaming for large datasets
4. Update memory thresholds if justified

### Debug Tools

#### 1. Verbose Test Output

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_comprehensive_integration.py -v -s --tb=long
```

#### 2. Memory Profiling

```bash
pip install memory_profiler
python -m memory_profiler tests/test_integration_runner.py
```

#### 3. Performance Profiling

```bash
pip install cProfile
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats tests/test_integration_runner.py
```

#### 4. Log Analysis

```bash
# Check application logs
tail -f logs/*.log

# Filter privacy pipeline logs
grep "privacy_pipeline" logs/*.log
```
