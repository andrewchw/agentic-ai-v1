# Agentic AI Revenue Assistant - Multi-Agent Architecture

## Overview
Transform the Agentic AI Revenue Assistant into a cutting-edge multi-agent collaborative system that showcases true agentic AI capabilities. Two specialized AI agents work together to analyze customer data, optimize revenue strategies, and demonstrate advanced agent-to-agent communication and task delegation.

## Strategic Vision
**Objective:** Demonstrate how a multi-agent AI system can help Hong Kong businesses increase revenue through collaborative AI decision-making, with strict data privacy and agent specialization.
