## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Data Input Layer**: CSV upload and validation
- **Privacy Layer**: Pseudonymization and encryption utilities
- **Data Storage**: Local encrypted JSON for demo data
- **AI Agent Layer**: Custom Python logic with OpenRouter/DeepSeek integration
- **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit web interface
- **Security Layer**: End-to-end data protection

### Technology Stack
- **LLM**: DeepSeek via OpenRouter API
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with Three HK styling
- **Backend**: Python with custom agent logic
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV handling
- **Privacy**: Custom pseudonymization utilities
- **Storage**: Local encrypted JSON files

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Basic Streamlit UI setup
- CSV upload functionality
- Data validation and error handling
- Sample data integration for testing

### Phase 2: Privacy & Security
- Pseudonymization engine implementation
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Privacy compliance validation
- Secure data transformation pipeline

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- OpenRouter API integration
- DeepSeek LLM configuration
- Agent reasoning logic development
- Lead analysis and prioritization algorithms

### Phase 4: Results & Dashboard
- Interactive results display
- Three HK branding implementation
- Export functionality
- Progress indicators and user feedback

### Phase 5: Polish & Production Ready
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization

- Documentation and deployment prep

## Logical Dependency Chain

1. **Infrastructure First**: Streamlit setup and basic file handling
2. **Data Security**: Privacy layer must be implemented before any LLM integration
3. **AI Core**: LLM integration only after privacy layer is complete
4. **User Interface**: Dashboard development follows data processing capabilities
5. **Integration**: All components integrated and tested together

## Suggested Actions Reference
Telecom offer templates including device upgrades, 5G plan upsells, data add-ons, family plans, streaming bundles, mobile insurance, roaming packs, loyalty discounts, retention campaigns, and personalized re-engagement offers.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Data Privacy**: Implement robust pseudonymization before any LLM processing
- **LLM Performance**: Use optimized open-source models for business context
- **Demo Scope**: Focus strictly on highest priority features

### Resource Constraints  
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- **Quick Value**: Get to working frontend quickly for demonstration
- **Iterative Development**: Build atomic features that can be improved incrementally
