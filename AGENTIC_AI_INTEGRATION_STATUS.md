## 🎯 **CrewAI Integration Plan**

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Now that we have proven the concept, here's how to integrate CrewAI for even more sophisticated collaboration:

#### **1. CrewAI Agent Definitions** (Next 30 minutes)
```python
# Define specialized crew roles
lead_intelligence_crew = Agent(
    role="Lead Intelligence Specialist",
    goal="Analyze customer data and identify high-value opportunities",
    backstory="Expert in Hong Kong telecom market analysis",
    tools=[data_analysis_tool, segmentation_tool, privacy_masking_tool]
)

sales_optimization_crew = Agent(
    role="Sales Strategy Optimizer", 
    goal="Generate personalized offers and revenue strategies",
    backstory="Revenue optimization specialist for Asian telecom markets",
    tools=[offer_generator_tool, email_template_tool, arpu_calculator_tool]
)

retention_specialist_crew = Agent(
    role="Customer Retention Expert",
    goal="Prevent churn and maximize customer lifetime value", 
    backstory="Specialized in Hong Kong customer behavior and retention strategies"
)
```

#### **2. CrewAI Task Orchestration**
```python
# Define crew workflow
revenue_acceleration_crew = Crew(
    agents=[lead_intelligence_crew, sales_optimization_crew, retention_specialist_crew],
    tasks=[customer_analysis_task, optimization_task, retention_task],
    process=Process.sequential,  # or Process.hierarchical
    verbose=True
)
```
