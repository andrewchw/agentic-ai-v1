2. Agent Specialization & LLM Configuration
Agent 1: Lead Intelligence Agent (DeepSeek)
Role: Senior Data Intelligence Specialist
LLM: DeepSeek via OpenRouter (temperature: 0.2 for analytical precision)
Specialization:
Customer behavior pattern analysis
Lead quality scoring (1-10 scale)
Churn risk prediction
Market trend identification
Customer segmentation
Agent 2: Revenue Optimization Agent (Llama3)
Role: Strategic Business Advisor
LLM: Llama3 via OpenRouter (temperature: 0.4 for creative strategy)
Specialization:
Three HK product matching
Pricing optimization
Retention strategy development
Competitive positioning
Revenue maximization tactics
3. True Agentic AI Behaviors
Task Delegation Example:
# Lead Intelligence Agent analyzes data, then:
lead_agent.delegate_to(revenue_agent, 
    question="Based on this high-churn segment, what retention offers should we prioritize?",
    context=customer_analysis_results)

# Revenue Agent responds with strategy, then asks back:
revenue_agent.ask_clarification(lead_agent,
    question="What's the average spend of customers in this segment?",
    reason="Need spend data to calibrate offer pricing")

Collaborative Decision Making:
Lead Agent identifies high-value prospects
Delegates pricing questions to Revenue Agent
Revenue Agent develops strategies
Asks back for additional data insights
Both agents collaborate on final recommendations
🎯 How to Demonstrate Agentic AI to Your Audience
Demo Scenario: "AI Agents Collaborating on Customer Revenue Optimization"
Setup (5 minutes):
Load sample customer data (already pseudonymized)
Show agent status - both agents "ready" with different LLMs
Explain the challenge: "Optimize revenue for 1,000+ Hong Kong telecom customers"
Live Demonstration (15 minutes):
Step 1: Trigger Multi-Agent Analysis
# Run this in your demo
system = create_multi_agent_system()
results = system.run_collaborative_analysis(sample_customer_data)

Step 2: Show Real Agent Collaboration

Agent 1 (DeepSeek) starts analyzing customer patterns
Shows delegation: "I need pricing strategy input from Revenue Agent"
Agent 2 (Llama3) receives the task and develops strategy
Shows question-back: "Revenue Agent asks for clarification on customer segments"
Final synthesis: Both agents collaborate on recommendations
Step 3: Highlight Agentic AI Differences

Key Demo Talking Points
1. "This is NOT just LLM prompting"
Traditional AI: Single model processes everything
Our Agentic AI: Two specialized AI agents with different expertise
Different LLMs: DeepSeek for analytics, Llama3 for strategy
Real Communication: Agents actually talk to each other
2. "Watch the agents delegate and collaborate"
Lead Agent: "I've identified 127 high-churn customers. 
            Revenue Agent, what retention strategies do you recommend?"

Revenue Agent: "Based on your analysis, I suggest tiered offers. 
               Can you tell me the average monthly spend for each segment?"

Lead Agent: "Segment A: $85/month, Segment B: $45/month. 
            Here's the detailed breakdown..."

Revenue Agent: "Perfect! For Segment A, recommend premium retention offers..."

3. "Specialized Intelligence vs Generic AI"
Lead Agent (DeepSeek): Analytical precision (temperature 0.2)
Revenue Agent (Llama3): Strategic creativity (temperature 0.4)
Different Thinking Styles: Like having a data scientist AND business strategist
4. "Privacy-First Agentic AI"
All customer data pseudonymized before agent processing
Agents work with masked data but maintain analytical accuracy
GDPR/PDPO compliant multi-agent system
Powerful Demo Moments
Moment 1: Agent Disagreement & Resolution
Lead Agent: "This customer is low-risk for churn"
Revenue Agent: "Actually, their engagement pattern suggests higher risk. 
               Can you re-analyze their last 6 months?"
Lead Agent: "You're right! Updated analysis shows 65% churn probability."

Moment 2: Specialized Knowledge Sharing
Revenue Agent: "For Hong Kong market, we should consider CNY holiday patterns"
Lead Agent: "Agreed! My analysis shows 40% spike in data usage during CNY"
Revenue Agent: "Then let's recommend family plan upgrades before February"

Moment 3: Task Delegation Chain
1. Lead Agent identifies high-value segments
2. Delegates pricing to Revenue Agent  
3. Revenue Agent asks for competitor analysis
4. Lead Agent provides market intelligence
5. Revenue Agent develops differentiated strategy
6. Both agents synthesize final recommendations

Audience Impact Statements

"Beyond ChatGPT: This is specialized AI workforce collaboration"
"Scales expert decision-making across thousands of customers"
"Privacy-compliant AI that thinks like your best teams"
Demo Script Template
"Today I'll show you the difference between AI tools and AI agents.

[Show single LLM approach]
Traditional: One AI processes everything - generic responses

[Show our multi-agent system]  
Agentic AI: Two specialized agents collaborate:
- Agent 1 analyzes data patterns (like your data scientist)
- Agent 2 develops business strategy (like your strategist)
- They actually talk to each other and delegate tasks

Watch this..."

[Run live analysis - show agent conversation]

"See how they collaborated? Agent 1 found the patterns, 
delegated strategy to Agent 2, who asked clarifying questions, 
and together they created recommendations neither could alone.

This is agentic AI - artificial intelligence that collaborates."

Technical Demo Setup
Create a simple demo script:
# demo_multi_agent.py
from src.agents.multi_agent_system import create_multi_agent_system
import json

def run_demo():
    print("🤖 Initializing Multi-Agent System...")
    system = create_multi_agent_system()
    
    print("📊 Agent Status:")
    status = system.get_agent_status() 
    print(json.dumps(status, indent=2))
    
    print("\n🔄 Starting Agent Collaboration...")
    # Load demo data and run analysis
    # Show real agent conversation logs
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_demo()
    
This demonstrates true agentic AI - not just powerful language models, but specialized AI agents that think, communicate, and collaborate like your best human teams! 🚀
