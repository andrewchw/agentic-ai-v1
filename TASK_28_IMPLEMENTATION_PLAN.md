# Task 28 Implementation Plan: Enhanced CSV Export for Multi-Agent Deliverables

## 🎯 **Objective**
Enhance the existing CSV export functionality to support the sophisticated deliverables generated by the CrewAI multi-agent system, including personalized offers, email templates, and customer recommendations.

## 📊 **Current vs Enhanced Export Scope**

### **Current Export (Basic)**
- Customer recommendations only
- Limited fields (Customer_ID, Priority, Action_Type, etc.)
- Single CSV file

### **Enhanced Export (Task 28)**
- **Multiple CSV files** for different deliverable types
- **Comprehensive data** from CrewAI multi-agent analysis
- **Business-ready format** for CRM integration
- **Professional structure** matching enterprise standards

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Enhance Export Functions** (`src/components/results.py`)

#### **1.1 Create Enhanced Export Functions**
```python
def export_crewai_offers_csv(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Export personalized offers from CrewAI results as CSV"""
    
def export_crewai_email_templates_csv(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Export email templates from CrewAI results as CSV"""
    
def export_crewai_recommendations_csv(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Export customer recommendations from CrewAI results as CSV"""
    
def export_crewai_campaign_summary_csv(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Export campaign summary metrics as CSV"""
```

#### **1.2 Create Multi-File Export Package**
```python
def create_export_package(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Create complete export package with all deliverable types"""
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    
    return {
        f"customer_offers_{timestamp}.csv": export_crewai_offers_csv(crewai_results),
        f"email_templates_{timestamp}.csv": export_crewai_email_templates_csv(crewai_results),
        f"customer_recommendations_{timestamp}.csv": export_crewai_recommendations_csv(crewai_results),
        f"campaign_summary_{timestamp}.csv": export_crewai_campaign_summary_csv(crewai_results)
    }
```

### **Phase 2: Update UI Components**

#### **2.1 Enhanced Export Section**
```python
def render_enhanced_export_section(results: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Render enhanced export options for CrewAI deliverables"""
    
    if "deliverables" in results:
        st.subheader("📦 Export Deliverables")
        
        col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns(4)
        
        with col1:
            if st.button("🎁 Export Customer Offers"):
                # Export offers CSV
                
        with col2:
            if st.button("📧 Export Email Templates"):
                # Export email templates CSV
                
        with col3:
            if st.button("📋 Export Recommendations"):
                # Export recommendations CSV
                
        with col4:
            if st.button("📦 Export Complete Package"):
                # Export all files as ZIP package
```

### **Phase 3: Data Structure Enhancement**

#### **3.1 Standardize CrewAI Export Data**
```python
def standardize_crewai_export_data(crewai_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Standardize CrewAI results for consistent CSV export"""
    
    deliverables = crewai_results.get("deliverables", {})
    
    return {
        "offers": deliverables.get("personalized_offers", []),
        "email_templates": deliverables.get("email_templates", []),
        "recommendations": deliverables.get("customer_recommendations", []),
        "summary": deliverables.get("summary_count", {}),
        "metadata": {
            "generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "system_version": "CrewAI Enhanced v1.0",
            "total_customers_analyzed": len(deliverables.get("personalized_offers", [])),
            "revenue_potential": sum([
                float(offer.get("revenue_impact", "0").replace("HK$", "").replace(",", "").replace(" annually", ""))
                for offer in deliverables.get("personalized_offers", [])
            ])
        }
    }
```
