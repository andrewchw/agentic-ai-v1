# Task ID: 14
# Title: Security and Compliance Features
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Production security validation and compliance verification for multi-agent systems, reflecting current built-in security features, recent validation results, and remaining enterprise requirements.
# Details:
The multi-agent system has been successfully validated with stable model configurations (Llama 3.3 70B + Mistral 7B), demonstrating robust operation and no DeepSeek R1 rate limiting issues. The privacy pipeline, data encryption, and API security are functioning correctly with OpenRouter integration. 

Current built-in security features include:
- Privacy Pipeline: Advanced pseudonymization and GDPR/PDPO compliance
- Data Encryption: Encrypted storage for sensitive customer data
- API Security: OpenRouter integration with secure API key management
- Cost Security: Free models eliminate billing/cost-related security risks
- Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging for compliance tracking

With foundational security and compliance controls validated, the system is ready to proceed with production security hardening. Enterprise-grade production deployment still requires:
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Multi-tenant access controls and role-based permissions
- SOC 2 Type II compliance validation
- Hong Kong PDPO specific compliance verification
- Enterprise firewall and network security integration
- Incident response and disaster recovery procedures

The system is compliant with GDPR and PDPO at the architectural level, and recent validation confirms correct functioning of privacy, encryption, and API security. The next phase focuses on implementing dynamic access controls, zero-trust policies, and robust incident response, as well as validating compliance through external audits.

# Test Strategy:
Validate existing privacy and encryption features (already completed). Confirm robust operation of model configurations (Llama 3.3 70B + Mistral 7B) and absence of DeepSeek R1 rate limiting issues. Conduct production security hardening and penetration testing. Verify implementation of multi-tenant access controls and role-based permissions. Perform SOC 2 Type II and Hong Kong PDPO compliance audits. Test enterprise firewall/network security integration. Simulate incident response and disaster recovery scenarios.
