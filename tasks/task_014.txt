# Task ID: 14
# Title: Security and Compliance Features
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Production security validation and compliance verification for multi-agent systems, reflecting current built-in security features and remaining enterprise requirements.
# Details:
The multi-agent system currently features advanced privacy-by-design architecture, including:
- Privacy Pipeline: Advanced pseudonymization and GDPR/PDPO compliance
- Data Encryption: Encrypted storage for sensitive customer data
- API Security: OpenRouter integration with secure API key management
- Cost Security: Free models eliminate billing/cost-related security risks
- Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging for compliance tracking

While foundational security and compliance controls are in place, enterprise-grade production deployment requires additional measures:
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Multi-tenant access controls and role-based permissions
- SOC 2 Type II compliance validation
- Hong Kong PDPO specific compliance verification
- Enterprise firewall and network security integration
- Incident response and disaster recovery procedures

The system is compliant with GDPR and PDPO at the architectural level, but further controls are needed for enterprise and regulatory standards such as SOC 2 Type II. The next phase focuses on implementing dynamic access controls, zero-trust policies, and robust incident response, as well as validating compliance through external audits.

# Test Strategy:
Validate existing privacy and encryption features. Conduct production security hardening and penetration testing. Verify implementation of multi-tenant access controls and role-based permissions. Perform SOC 2 Type II and Hong Kong PDPO compliance audits. Test enterprise firewall/network security integration. Simulate incident response and disaster recovery scenarios.
