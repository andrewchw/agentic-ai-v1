The system implements two distinct privacy layers: (1) Security Pseudonymization for irreversible anonymization before external LLM processing, and (2) Display Masking for reversible, toggle-controlled UI masking. All modules are fully compliant with GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO requirements, with comprehensive documentation of privacy principles, technical implementation, and security measures. The Security Pseudonymization module is integrated and operational, providing irreversible anonymization for all sensitive fields before any external processing. The enhanced sensitive field identification system covers 13 PII types, supports Hong Kong-specific patterns, confidence scoring, and unified integration for both privacy layers. The reversible display masking system is fully integrated, supporting all PII types with specialized masking patterns, toggle control, confidence-based masking, Hong Kong localization, and performance optimization. All masking and detection features have been validated with a comprehensive test suite and demo. The local encrypted storage system for original PII is fully implemented and validated, providing AES-256-GCM encryption, PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation, secure access control, audit logging, data integrity verification, secure deletion, and DataFrame storage/retrieval. Security documentation and compliance validation for GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO are complete. The privacy pipeline is now fully integrated with the upload component: all uploaded data is automatically processed through the complete privacy system, with integration tests passed and comprehensive validation performed. The privacy-first data processing pipeline is production-ready and fully operational, ensuring all customer data is automatically secured with enterprise-grade privacy protection while maintaining full usability for authorized analysis.",

Provide meaningful error messages to end users where applicable.\n<info added on 2025-07-17T04:41:12.199Z>\nResponse validation and error handling are now fully implemented and integrated throughout the OpenRouter API client. The system classifies errors by type, mapping HTTP status codes to specific exception classes (e.g., AuthenticationError for 401, RateLimitError for 429, QuotaExceededError for 402/403, ModelUnavailableError for 404, TimeoutError for 408/504, ServerError for 500+). Validation logic inspects both the structure and content of API responses, ensuring required fields (such as 'choices', 'message', and 'content') are present and correctly formatted. Responses are checked for minimum content length and format-specific requirements (JSON/text), with malformed or incomplete responses detected and handled gracefully. Error responses are parsed from both object and string formats, supporting complex nested error structures and providing fallback handling for unknown formats. User-facing error messages are generated for each error type, translating technical issues into actionable guidance and clear instructions. The enhanced completion method, `_enhanced_completion_with_validation()`, enforces input parameter validation (prompt length, temperature, max_tokens) and provides a robust validation pipeline for the entire request/response cycle. All business analysis workflows now leverage these validation and error handling improvements, including structured JSON validation for customer analysis, lead scoring, and recommendations. Comprehensive logging and monitoring are in place for all error scenarios. Testing confirms correct handling of response structure, content validation, error parsing, input validation, and edge cases, with only minor issues in user message display. The implementation maintains backward compatibility and delivers enterprise-grade robustness, reliability, and user experience.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T04:41:12.199Z>",

The system features a comprehensive `BusinessAnalysisWorkflow` class that orchestrates all OpenRouter API components, enabling a seamless pipeline for customer pattern analysis, lead scoring, and personalized sales recommendations. The workflow supports both complete and modular analysis types, allowing for flexible usage depending on business needs.\n\nStructured data handling is implemented via `AnalysisRequest` and `AnalysisResult` objects, ensuring consistent input and output formats. Privacy compliance is maintained through automatic integration with SecurityPseudonymizer, with graceful fallback mechanisms in place if privacy components are unavailable. All customer data, purchase history, and engagement data are securely prepared before API transmission.\n\nRobust error handling is built in, with the workflow gracefully managing API failures, network issues, and malformed data. Detailed error reporting and user-friendly messages are provided, and the system is resilient enough to continue processing even if individual components fail.\n\nPerformance monitoring is integrated throughout the workflow, tracking processing times, token usage, request counts, and success rates for each analysis component. Batch processing capabilities are included via `process_batch_analysis()`, supporting efficient handling of multiple customer analyses with rate limiting and progress tracking.\n\nConvenience functions such as `create_workflow()` and `quick_customer_analysis()` are available for rapid setup and one-off analyses.
