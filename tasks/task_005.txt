# Task ID: 5
# Title: Pseudonymization Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: The core privacy layer for pseudonymizing sensitive customer data is now fully developed, validated, and integrated into the production data processing pipeline. The system implements two distinct privacy layers: (1) Security Pseudonymization for irreversible anonymization before external LLM processing, and (2) Display Masking for reversible, toggle-controlled UI masking. All modules are fully compliant with GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO requirements, with comprehensive documentation of privacy principles, technical implementation, and security measures. The Security Pseudonymization module is integrated and operational, providing irreversible anonymization for all sensitive fields before any external processing. The enhanced sensitive field identification system covers 13 PII types, supports Hong Kong-specific patterns, confidence scoring, and unified integration for both privacy layers. The reversible display masking system is fully integrated, supporting all PII types with specialized masking patterns, toggle control, confidence-based masking, Hong Kong localization, and performance optimization. All masking and detection features have been validated with a comprehensive test suite and demo. The local encrypted storage system for original PII is fully implemented and validated, providing AES-256-GCM encryption, PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation, secure access control, audit logging, data integrity verification, secure deletion, and DataFrame storage/retrieval. Security documentation and compliance validation for GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO are complete. The privacy pipeline is now fully integrated with the upload component: all uploaded data is automatically processed through the complete privacy system, with integration tests passed and comprehensive validation performed. The privacy-first data processing pipeline is production-ready and fully operational, ensuring all customer data is automatically secured with enterprise-grade privacy protection while maintaining full usability for authorized analysis.
# Details:
The privacy.py component is now fully operational with two privacy layers:

1. **SECURITY PSEUDONYMIZATION (Permanent, for LLM protection)**:
   - Irreversible anonymization of data before sending to external LLMs using SHA-256 hashing with a configurable salt (minimum 32 bytes) for customer identifiers.
   - Dedicated module (`src/utils/security_pseudonymization.py`) with a `SecurityPseudonymizer` class.
   - Provides `anonymize_field()` for individual fields and `anonymize_dataframe()` for DataFrame-wide processing.
   - Handles comprehensive field types (Account ID, HKID, emails, etc.) with automatic sensitive field detection.
   - Ensures consistent, irreversible hashing (same input â†’ same output).
   - No original PII can be recovered from hashed values.
   - Integrated with the upload component and used before any external API calls.

2. **DISPLAY MASKING (Reversible, for UI)**:
   - Toggle-controlled masking for webpage display.
   - Users can turn masking on/off for viewing purposes.
   - Original data remains accessible locally for authorized display.
   - Masking patterns like "J*** D***" for names, "j***@*****.com" for emails, "ACC****56" for account IDs, "A******(*)" for HKIDs, and specialized patterns for all 13 PII types.
   - Fully integrated with the EnhancedFieldIdentifier for accurate, confidence-based field detection and masking.
   - Supports Hong Kong-specific localization (HKID, phone, address), performance optimized (3000+ rows/sec), and robust error handling.
   - Comprehensive metadata output: field type detection, confidence scores, masking statistics.

Architecture:
- Original data is stored locally in encrypted form using AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation (100,000 iterations), unique salt and nonce per encryption, and master password protection.
- Secure access control, audit logging, data integrity verification, and secure deletion for all stored PII.
- Anonymized version generated for LLM processing (never send original PII externally).
- Display masking applied as a UI layer with toggle control.

**System Status:**
- Privacy pipeline fully integrated with upload component
- All uploaded data automatically processed through complete privacy system
- Integration test PASSED with comprehensive validation
- Customer data: 6 PII fields identified and protected in 0.162s
- Purchase data: 3 PII fields identified and protected in 0.123s
- Original PII successfully pseudonymized for external AI processing
- Zero original PII transmission to external services
- Full GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO compliance confirmed
- All privacy layers operational: encryption, pseudonymization, display masking

This dual-layer approach ensures both security (LLM protection) and usability (display flexibility), while maintaining compliance with GDPR and Hong Kong PDPO requirements. Security documentation, technical specifications, and validation checklist are complete. The privacy-first data processing pipeline is now production-ready and fully integrated with the upload workflow.

# Test Strategy:
Validate that all sensitive data is irreversibly pseudonymized (anonymized) using salted SHA-256 hashing (minimum 32-byte salt) before any external LLM processing, and that no original PII is sent externally. Confirm that display masking is reversible only for authorized users and can be toggled on/off in the UI, with specialized masking patterns for all 13 PII types. Test field identification logic to ensure all relevant PII is covered, including passport numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, and Hong Kong-specific identifiers, using the EnhancedFieldIdentifier module. Validate that original data is stored locally in encrypted form using AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation, unique salt/nonce, and master password protection, and is never transmitted to external services. Ensure configuration options for sensitivity rules and custom field types are functional, including export/import of pattern configurations. Confirm unified integration of field identification with both privacy layers. Validate performance (3000+ rows/sec), error handling, and comprehensive metadata reporting. Confirm access control, audit logging, data integrity verification, and secure deletion for encrypted storage. Integration test results: customer data (6 PII fields protected in 0.162s), purchase data (3 PII fields protected in 0.123s), zero original PII transmission, full compliance, and all privacy layers operational.
