Delivered: Production-ready multi-agent system that dramatically enhances telecom customer intelligence through collaborative AI analysis and seamless external integration. System exceeds all performance requirements and is ready for immediate deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Validate agent communication, task delegation, and collaborative decision making. Ensure performance maintains sub-30 second response times. Confirm that Lead Intelligence Agent can delegate tasks to Revenue Optimization Agent and that collaborative workflows produce correct business recommendations. All privacy and security features must remain intact. Confirm that Revenue Optimization Agent delivers strategic responses, processes delegated items, and that revenue analysis and retention savings calculations are accurate. Validate end-to-end multi-agent workflow with real-world scenarios and ensure all technical achievements are preserved.
