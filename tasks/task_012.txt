# Task ID: 12
# Title: Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform single-agent system to collaborative multi-agent platform using CrewAI framework.
# Details:
Strategic pivot to showcase true agentic AI capabilities with two specialized agents: (1) Lead Intelligence Agent using DeepSeek LLM for data analysis and pattern recognition, and (2) Revenue Optimization Agent using Llama3 LLM for business strategy and optimization. CrewAI framework is installed, configured, and operational. Agent orchestration is functioning, and both agents are initialized. Lead Intelligence Agent is fully implemented with DeepSeek LLM, supporting advanced customer analysis, lead scoring, churn risk assessment, segmentation, and task delegation to the Revenue Agent. Demo scripts confirm multi-agent collaboration and successful delegation. Next, implement the Revenue Optimization Agent using Llama3 LLM and complete the remaining integration and testing steps.

# Test Strategy:
Validate agent communication, task delegation, and collaborative decision making. Ensure performance maintains sub-30 second response times. Confirm that Lead Intelligence Agent can delegate tasks to Revenue Optimization Agent and that collaborative workflows produce correct business recommendations. All privacy and security features must remain intact.

# Subtasks:
## 12.1. Install and Configure CrewAI Framework [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install CrewAI dependencies and set up basic agent orchestration infrastructure.
### Details:
Install crewai package, configure agent framework, and establish basic orchestration patterns. Create agent base classes and communication protocols.

## 12.2. Implement Lead Intelligence Agent (DeepSeek) [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create specialized agent for customer data analysis using DeepSeek LLM via OpenRouter.
### Details:
Transform existing customer analysis algorithms into agent-based architecture. Specialize in data analysis, pattern recognition, lead scoring, and customer segmentation. Configure DeepSeek LLM integration. Lead Intelligence Agent fully implemented with DeepSeek LLM. Advanced customer analysis algorithms deployed. Lead scoring, churn risk assessment, and segmentation working. Task delegation to Revenue Agent operational. Demo script successfully demonstrates agent collaboration. All tests passing with proper environment activation.

## 12.3. Implement Revenue Optimization Agent (Llama3) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create specialized agent for business strategy using Llama3 LLM via OpenRouter.
### Details:
Transform existing Three HK business rules into agent-based architecture. Specialize in offer matching, pricing strategy, retention recommendations, and revenue optimization. Configure Llama3 LLM integration. Ensure the agent can receive delegated tasks from the Lead Intelligence Agent and respond with actionable business recommendations.

## 12.4. Implement Agent Communication and Task Delegation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable agents to communicate, delegate tasks, and collaborate on recommendations.
### Details:
Implement inter-agent communication protocols, task delegation workflows, question-answer mechanisms, and collaborative decision making. Ensure agents can ask each other questions and work together. Validate that the Lead Intelligence Agent's delegation to the Revenue Optimization Agent is handled correctly and that responses are integrated into the overall workflow.

## 12.5. Integration Testing and Performance Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test multi-agent system integration and validate performance metrics.
### Details:
Comprehensive testing of agent collaboration, communication reliability, and system performance. Ensure sub-30 second response times and maintain all existing privacy/security features. Confirm that the system can handle real-world scenarios as demonstrated in the completed demo, including multi-segment analysis, lead identification, churn detection, and revenue optimization recommendations.
