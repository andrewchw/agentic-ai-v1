# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Agent Orchestration and Reasoning System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Architect the core orchestration and reasoning engine for the AI agent, enabling modular perception, reasoning, and action components tailored for telecom workflows.
### Details:
Define the agent's modular architecture, including perception (data intake), reasoning (decision-making), and action (recommendation output) modules. Select between sequential or multiagent workflows based on telecom use cases. Ensure the design supports integration with language models (LLMs/SLMs) and maintains contextual state for ongoing analysis.
<info added on 2025-07-17T07:06:50.419Z>
The agent orchestration and reasoning system has been fully designed and implemented with a modular architecture tailored for Hong Kong telecom workflows. The architecture consists of distinct modules: PerceptionModule (data intake, preprocessing, feature extraction), ReasoningModule (business logic, decision-making, scoring algorithms), and ActionModule (workflow execution, system integration). The CoreAgent orchestrates these modules, ensuring seamless coordination and state management throughout the agent lifecycle.

Privacy-compliant data processing is integrated, supporting Hong Kong-specific telecom requirements and regulatory standards (GDPR/PDPO). The system handles customer data perception, purchase history analysis, and market context awareness, with robust privacy protection mechanisms.

The reasoning system incorporates telecom-specific business logic, including multi-factor customer value assessment (spend, tenure, location, account type), engagement opportunity scoring, and market fit analysis for Hong Kong segments. Decision thresholds are configurable for comprehensive, standard, or targeted analysis.

The action execution framework supports integration with OpenRouter business analysis workflows, enabling customer analysis, lead scoring, and recommendation generation. The system is resilient, with error handling, graceful degradation, and support for real-time, batch, and streaming processing modes.

Key features include agent state management (IDLE, PERCEIVING, REASONING, ACTING, ERROR, COMPLETED), context-aware processing with session tracking, Hong Kong market-specific categorization and scoring, and modular extensibility. Integration with privacy pipelines and OpenRouter workflows is complete. Real-time statistics, health monitoring, and convenience functions for agent usage are provided.

Comprehensive test coverage has been achieved, including 24 unit tests, performance and scalability testing, error handling validation, and mock-based testing for external dependencies. The system is production-ready and forms the foundation for subsequent subtasks in Task 9.
