## 1. Implement Encrypted JSON Storage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a secure mechanism to store processed and pseudonymized data as encrypted JSON files on the local system.
### Details:
Select a robust encryption library (e.g., AES-256) and integrate it into the storage layer. Ensure that all data written to disk is encrypted at rest. Design the storage format to support both demonstration data and analysis results, and document the encryption key management approach.
<info added on 2025-07-16T07:52:14.426Z>
Implementation analysis and planning for the encrypted JSON storage system:

- The `src/utils/encrypted_json_storage.py` module will encapsulate all AES-256 encrypted JSON operations, using the industry-standard `cryptography` library for robust encryption and decryption processes[1][2].
- AES-256-GCM mode is selected for authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of stored data by preventing unauthorized tampering.
- PBKDF2 will be used for secure key derivation from user-provided secrets, adding an additional layer of security to key management.
- The storage format will be designed to flexibly support both demonstration data and analysis results, with JSON serialization and proper encoding/decoding to handle diverse data types.
- Storage keys will be managed separately from session keys, aligning with best practices for cryptographic separation of concerns.
- All encrypted files will be written and read atomically to prevent partial writes and ensure data consistency.
- The abstraction layer will provide simple interfaces for encrypted read/write operations, handling encryption, decryption, and error management transparently.
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation will be implemented to mitigate risks of data corruption, unauthorized access, or cryptographic misuse.
- Documentation will cover encryption key management, usage patterns, and security considerations for developers and users.

References to implementation examples and cryptographic best practices are drawn from current guides and documentation on AES-256 encryption in Python[1][2][5].

Implementation of the encrypted JSON storage system is complete and fully validated.

Key deliverables:
- Developed `src/utils/encrypted_json_storage.py` with robust AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of stored data.
- Integrated PBKDF2 key derivation with random salts (100,000 iterations) for secure password-based key management.

## 2. Establish Secure Session Management [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and implement session management to handle data access, encryption keys, and lifecycle during user sessions.
### Details:
Create a session manager that generates and securely stores encryption keys in memory for the duration of a session. Ensure keys are never written to disk and are destroyed at session end. Track active sessions and associate them with corresponding data files.
<info added on 2025-07-16T07:56:53.644Z>
Implementation of the secure session management system will proceed as follows:

- Develop the `src/utils/session_manager.py` module to encapsulate all session management logic, ensuring modularity and ease of integration.
- Design session lifecycle management, including secure session creation (with cryptographically secure random session IDs of at least 128 bits), active session tracking, and explicit session termination. Session IDs will be generated using a CSPRNG to prevent predictability and brute-force attacks[1][2][3][4].
- Implement in-memory encryption key management: encryption keys are generated per session, stored only in volatile memory, and securely destroyed upon session termination. Keys are never written to disk, and secure deletion routines will be used to minimize memory remanence.
- Enforce session-based data access controls, ensuring each session is isolated and can only access its own data. Integrate with the encrypted JSON storage layer to provide session-scoped data access.
- Add session cleanup procedures, including automatic timeout handling (with configurable inactivity thresholds) and explicit logout support. Sessions are invalidated and all associated sensitive data is purged on termination or timeout[1][3][4].
- Ensure thread-safe operations to support concurrent multi-user scenarios, using appropriate synchronization mechanisms.
- Implement audit logging for session operations (creation, access, termination) to support monitoring and incident response.

Key security requirements:
- Session keys and IDs are never persisted to disk.
- All sensitive data is stored in memory only for the session duration and securely deleted at session end.
- Session isolation is strictly enforced to prevent cross-session data leakage.
- Automatic timeout and cleanup mechanisms are in place to minimize risk from abandoned sessions.
- All session operations are logged for auditability and compliance.

This approach aligns with industry best practices for secure session management, including strong session ID generation, session expiration, secure in-memory key handling, and robust access controls[1][2][3][4].
