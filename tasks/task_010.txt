# Task ID: 10
# Title: Lead Scoring and Prioritization Algorithm
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: This task is redundant. A comprehensive Lead Scoring and Prioritization Algorithm has already been implemented and tested in Task 9.3 (LeadScoringEngine), which includes multi-factor scoring, a 5-tier priority system, a 4-level qualification system, and full explainability for the Hong Kong telecom market. No further action is required for this task.
# Details:
All requirements for lead scoring and prioritization are fully met by Task 9.3. The implemented system features: multi-factor scoring (Revenue Potential 35%, Conversion Probability 30%, Urgency Factor 20%, Strategic Value 15%), a 5-tier priority system (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Nurture), a 4-level qualification system (Hot, Warm, Cold, Unqualified), performance of 4,500+ leads per second, and full explainability. The next step is Task 12 (Results Dashboard Implementation) to provide a user interface for the AI agent system.

# Test Strategy:
No further testing required. Functionality has been validated and reviewed as part of Task 9.3.
