# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Integration Testing and Demo Data Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and automate an end-to-end integration testing pipeline using demo data, validating interactions between upload, validation, and privacy components, and ensuring system performance with realistic data volumes.
# Details:
After completion of Task 5 (Pseudonymization Engine), design and implement a robust integration testing framework that covers the full data flow from upload through validation and privacy processing. Prepare representative demo data files that mimic real-world scenarios, including edge cases and privacy-sensitive records. Automate the ingestion, validation, and pseudonymization of these files, ensuring all interfaces and data handoffs are tested. Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline to execute these tests on every relevant build. Include performance testing with large, realistic data volumes to assess system throughput and identify bottlenecks. Document test cases, data preparation steps, and acceptance criteria. Ensure the pipeline is maintainable and extensible for future components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the automated pipeline successfully runs end-to-end tests using demo data, covering all integration points between upload, validation, and privacy modules. Confirm that demo data is correctly processed, privacy rules are enforced, and outputs match expected results. Validate that performance benchmarks are met with large data sets. Review logs and reports for errors, failures, and bottlenecks. Ensure all test cases are documented and reproducible, and that the pipeline triggers automatically in the CI/CD environment.
